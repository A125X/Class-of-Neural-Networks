# Class-of-Neural-Networks
Neural network constructor.

I mastered the methods of creating and training neural networks, and in the process created a class that allows you to work with multilayer perceptrons.

I have to provide to the model constructor information about the layers.

It have to be a list of amount of neurons in every layer, including an input and the output.

Also for the training i have to provide learning rate, amount of training cycles, amount of epochs, batch size and trainings data.

Class methods use numpy for matrix and their multiplication, random to get random weights and matplotlib.pyplot to visualize some trainings data.
